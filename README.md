# 2023 VCE Stats Tool

Hi, welcome to my VCE stats tool! Code is deployed [here](https://redzgoose.shinyapps.io/redz_vce_statistics_tool/).

## Short Description

A tool for visualizing statistics for the VCE results for alumni (students scoring over 40 in any subject) of 2023. Created by a Year 9 student (me :P) so should be understandable enough!

Select anything on the navigation bar to view its visualization - for example, popular subjects will show you the subjects which had the most students scoring over 40. You can customize visualizations by changing the dropdowns, sliders and checkboxes.

## Long Description

There are six types of visualizations available:
- Popular subjects (subjecst with most people scoring over 40)
- Number of students by score (by subject)
- School rankings by subject
- Student results searcher
- Pie charts of locally collected response data
- Linear bar charts of locally collected response data
